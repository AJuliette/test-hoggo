# :penguin: Hoggo Test

This is my implementation of the Hoggo Backend Challenge :tada:

## Usage

```
bundle install
```

You have to add a DSN file to the data folder. The parser can be then launched as following

```
ruby main.rb
```

I made an attempt using the gem `parslet` that you can see on the branch

```
git branch parslet
```



Looking forward to discussing with you !

Have a nice review :eyes:
